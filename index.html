    <header class="hola">JavaScript basics</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
        <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
 
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>  
        <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples</li>
        <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
        <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
        <p>It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.</p>
        <p>The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!</p>
        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
        <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)</p>
        <p>The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.

Following that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent property (which represents the content of the heading) to Hello world!.</p>
        <p>To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's explain some of the core features of the language. It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, you have a head start on coding in other languages too!</p> 
        <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called main.js, and save it.</li>
        <li>In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing </body> tag:</li>  
</section>    
<section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_first_steps">
    <header class="hola">JavaScript first steps</header>
        <p>In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.</p>
        <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous JavaScript knowledge, but you should have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. You are advised to work through the following modules before starting on JavaScript:</p>

        <p>In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.</p>
        <p>Before starting this module, you should have some familiarity with the basics of HTML and CSS, and you should have also worked through our previous module, JavaScript first steps.</p>
        <p>The standard for loop
In the "drawing circles" example above, you don't have a collection of items to loop through: you really just want to run the same code 100 times. In a case like that, you should use the for loop. This has the following syntax:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

          <code></code>
        <li>The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.
</li>
        <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:</li>
        <li>An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.</li>
        <li>A condition — this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.</li>
        <li>A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer true.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Introducing_JavaScript_objects">
    <header class="hola">Introducing JavaScript objects</header>
        <p>In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages and act as handy data containers. The object-based nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, then look at how to create your own objects.</p>
        <p>Prerequisites
Before starting this module, you should have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. You are advised to work through the Introduction to HTML and Introduction to CSS modules before starting on JavaScript.</p>
        <p>You should also have some familiarity with JavaScript basics before looking at JavaScript objects in detail. Before attempting this module, work through JavaScript first steps and JavaScript building blocks.</p>
        <p>In this article, we'll look at fundamental JavaScript object syntax, and revisit some JavaScript features that we've already seen earlier in the course, reiterating the fact that many of the features you've already dealt with are objects.</p>
        <p>Using object literals is fine when you only need to create one object, but if you have to create more than one, as in the previous section, they're seriously inadequate. We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a height property - then we have to remember to update every object.</p>
        <p>We would like a way to define the "shape" of an object — the set of methods and the properties it can have — and then create as many objects as we like, just updating the values for the properties that are different.</p>
        <p>This function creates and returns a new object each time we call it. The object will have two members:</p>

          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
          <code></code>
                  <li>a property name</li>
        <li>a method introduceSelf().</li>
        <p>Note that createPerson() takes a parameter name to set the value of the name property, but the value of the introduceSelf() method will be the same for all objects created using this function. This is a very common pattern for creating objects.</p>
        <p>Now we can create as many objects as we like, reusing the definition:</p>
        <p>This works fine but is a bit long-winded: we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it. A better way is to use a constructor. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:</p> 
        <li>create a new object</li>
        <li>bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code</li>
        <li>run the code in the constructor</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Grammar_and_types">
    <header class="hola">Grammar and types</header>
    <p>This chapter discusses JavaScript's basic grammar, variable declarations, data types and literals.</p>
      <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
      <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
      <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
      <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
      <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>    
    <li>var</li>
    <li>let</li>
    <li>const</li>
   




</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Control_flow_and_error_handling">
    <header class="hola">Control flow and error handling</header>
  <p>JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an overview of these statements.</p>
  <p>The JavaScript reference contains exhaustive details about the statements in this chapter. The semicolon (;) character is used to separate statements in JavaScript code.</p>
  <p>Any JavaScript expression is also a statement. See Expressions and operators for complete information about expressions.</p>
  <p>Block statement
The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:</p>
  <p>Best practice
In general, it's good practice to always use block statements—especially when nesting if statements:</p>
  <p>In general it's good practice to not have an if...else with an assignment like x = y as a condition:</p>
  <p>The following values evaluate to false (also known as Falsy values):</p>
    <li>false</li>
    <li>undefined</li>
    <li>null</li>
      <li>0</li> 
    <li>NaN</li>
    <li>the empty string ("")</li>
   
  
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Loops_and_iteration">
    <header class="hola">Loops and iteration</header>
  <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.</p>
  <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
  <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)</p>
  <p>The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>
  <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
    <li>for statement</li>
    <li>do...while statement</li>
    <li>while statement</li>
      <li>labeled statement</li> 
    <li>break statement</li>
    <li>continue statement</li>
    <li>for...in statement</li>
    <li>for...of statement</li>
  
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Functions">
    <header class="hola">Functions</header>
  <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
  <p>See also the exhaustive reference chapter about JavaScript functions to get to know the details.</p>
  <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
    <li>The name of the function.</li>
    <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* … */ }.</li>
 
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Expressions_and_operators">
    <header class="hola">Expressions and operators</header>
  <p>This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.</p>
  <p>At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.</p>
  <p>The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.</p>
  <p>The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const z = 3 + 4), its result will be immediately discarded — this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects.</p>
  <p>As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +. In this section, we will introduce the following operators:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
    <li>Assignment operators</li>
    <li>Comparison operators</li>
    <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
      <li>Bitwise operators</li> 
    <li>Logical operators</li>
    <li>BigInt operators</li>
    <li>String operators</li>
    <li>Conditional (ternary) operator</li>
    <li>Comma operator</li>
    <li>Unary operators</li>
    <li>Relational operators</li>
    

  
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Numbers_and_dates">
    <header class="hola">Numbers and dates</header>
  <p>This chapter introduces the concepts, objects and functions used to work with and perform calculations using numbers and dates in JavaScript. This includes using numbers written in various bases including decimal, binary, and hexadecimal, as well as the use of the global Math object to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on numbers.</p>
  <p>JavaScript does not have a date data type. However, you can use the Date object and its methods to work with dates and times in your applications. The Date object has a large number of methods for setting, getting, and manipulating dates. It does not have any properties.</p>
  <p>JavaScript handles dates similarly to Java. The two languages have many of the same date methods, and both languages store dates as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, with a Unix Timestamp being the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.</p>
  <p>The Date object range is -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to 01 January, 1970 UTC.</p>
  <p>To create a Date object:</p>
  <p>Calling Date without the new keyword returns a string representing the current date and time.</p>
  <p>The parameters in the preceding syntax can be any of the following:</p>
    <li>Nothing: creates today's date and time. For example, today = new Date();.</li>
    <li>A string representing a date in the following form: "Month day, year hours:minutes:seconds." For example, let Xmas95 = new Date("December 25, 1995 13:30:00"). If you omit hours, minutes, or seconds, the value will be set to zero.</li>
    <li>A set of integer values for year, month, and day. For example, let Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25)</li>
      <li>A set of integer values for year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds. For example, let Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25, 9, 30, 0);.</li> 
    <li>"set" methods, for setting date and time values in Date objects.</li>
    <li>"get" methods, for getting date and time values from Date objects.</li>
    <li>"to" methods, for returning string values from Date objects.</li>
